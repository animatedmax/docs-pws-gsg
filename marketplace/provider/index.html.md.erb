## <a id='integration'></a>Integrating With Cloud Foundry ##

Cloud Foundry has partnered with AppDirect for services integration with our 
public PaaS at [run.pivotal.io](https://run.pivotal.io). 
Service providers interested in adding their service to the Pivotal CF 
Marketplace should contact [Nima Badiey](mailto:nbadiey@gopivotal.com) for more 
information. 

Documentation on AppDirect's API for Cloud Foundry can be found here:
[http://info.appdirect.com/developer/docs/cloud-foundry/](http://info.appdirect.com/developer/docs/cloud-foundry/)

## <a id='docs'></a>Documentation ##

Service providers should feel enabled to manage their own documentation. 
Clone the [cf-docs repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-docs) and issue pull 
requests to update your Marketplace Services documentation page. 

Your documentation page should reside in 
`source/docs/dotcom/services-marketplace`.

There is a template available to get you started. 
Please include the Managing Services and Support sections with links included; 
feel free to add additional information as appropriate. 
If your service is bindable, you should include the section on Environment 
Variables.

## <a id='sample-apps'></a>Sample Apps ##

Providing a sample application that works out of the box provides an excellent 
user experience. 
Developers can validate that your service works as expected, and the sample app 
should provide a code example for how to integrate an application with your 
service. 
There are two ways we recommend publishing your sample application:

1. You can host your sample app in your own repo, and we can fork it into 
https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples
2. You can send us the code for your app and we can add a new repo to 
https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples
