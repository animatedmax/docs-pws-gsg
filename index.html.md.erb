title: Getting Started with Pivotal Web Services
---

You can deploy, update, and scale your applications on Pivotal Web Services (PWS), which is powered by the Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service (PaaS).

To deploy applications to PWS, you must first sign up for a PWS account, install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, and log in to PWS using the Cloud Foundry public API endpoint: `api.run.pivotal.io`.

## <a id='signup'></a>Step 1: Set Up Your PWS Account ##

This step establishes your PWS account and access to the PWS Developer Console for your account.

Sign up for a Pivotal Web Services account: https://console.run.pivotal.io

The Developer Console displays after you create an [organization](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/concepts/roles.html#organizations) (org). By default, PWS configures each new org with a [space](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/concepts/roles.html#spaces) named `development`.

## <a id='install-login'></a>Step 2: Install the cf CLI ##

The `cf` CLI is your primary tool for deploying and managing your applications.

1. Click [Tools](https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools) on the left navigation menu of the Developer Console to access the Tools page.

1. Install the appropriate `cf` CLI version for your OS.
1. Run `cf help` to confirm that the tool is installed correctly.
The example shows the beginning lines of output for this command.

<pre class=”terminal”>
$ cf help
NAME:
   cf - A command line tool to interact with Cloud Foundry

USAGE:
   [environment variables] cf [global options] command [arguments...] [command options] 
...
</pre>


## <a id='connect-api'></a>Step 3: Connect to PWS Using the Cloud Foundry Public API ##

This step targets the Cloud Foundry public API endpoint `api.run.pivotal.io` and establishes your connection to PWS.

1. Run `cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io`

1. Enter the email and password that you established in Step 1.

The example shows the output of this command. When your account contains only a single org and space, PWS automatically targets them. Otherwise, PWS prompts you to select an org and space.

<pre class=”terminal”>
$ cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io

API endpoint: https://api.run.pivotal.io

Email> joeclouduser@acme.com

Password> 
Authenticating...
OK

Targeted org Cloud-Apps

Targeted space development


                   
API endpoint:   https://api.run.pivotal.io (API version: 2.8.0)   
User:           joeclouduser@acme.com   
Org:            Cloud-Apps   
Space:          development  
</pre>

You are now ready to deploy applications.

## <a id='deploy-app'></a>Step 4: Deploy an Application to PWS ##

For help pushing your app to PWS, choose the appropriate Quick Start deployment guide for the following supported languages:

* [Java](quickstart-java.html.md): For Java, Grails, Play, Spring, and any other JVM-based apps
* [Go](quickstart-go.html.md)
* [Node.js](quickstart-nodejs.html.md): For JavaScript and Node apps
* [Ruby](quickstart-ruby.html.md): For Ruby, Rack, and Sinatra apps
* [Rails](quickstart-rails.html.md)
