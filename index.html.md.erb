title: Getting Started with Pivotal Web Services
---

_This page assumes that you are using cf v6._

Pivotal Web Services makes a Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service (PaaS)
available as the environment to which you deploy your applications.
The Pivotal Web Services PaaS is at `run.pivotal.io`.

Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy, and
scale your apps.

Complete the following steps to get started:

1. [Sign up for an account](#signup)
1. [Install the `cf` command line tool and log in](#install-cf)
1. [Prepare an application on your local machine](#prepare-app)
1. [Push your application code to the cloud](#push-app)

## <a id='signup'></a>Sign Up for Pivotal Web Services and Log In ##

[Sign up](https://console.run.pivotal.io) for a Pivotal Web Services account.

[Log in](https://login.run.pivotal.io/login).

**Note**: If you had an account on `cloudfoundry.com`, your account credentials
have been transferred to Pivotal Web Services.

## <a id='install-login'></a>Install the cf Command Line Interface and Log In ##

### <a id='install-cf'></a>Download and Install cf ###

Download `cf` from the [tools page](https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools).

Complete the [installation instructions](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/installcf/index.html).

### <a id='target'></a>Log In ###

Run `cf api api.run.pivotal.io` to target the `run.pivotal.io` API endpoint.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf api api.run.pivotal.io
Setting api endpoint to api.run.pivotal.io...
OK

API endpoint: https://api.run.pivotal.io (API version: 2.0.0)
Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
</pre>

Run `cf login` to login.
`cf` prompts you for your username, password, organization, and space.

Cloud Foundry spaces are containers for applications and all their
associated processes.
By default, your account has three spaces: development, production, and staging.
You can deploy your application to whichever space you choose.

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf login
API endpoint: https://api.run.pivotal.io

Username> user@example.com

Password>********
Authenticating...
OK

Select an org (or press enter to skip):
1. my-org

Org> 1
Targeted org my-org

Select a space (or press enter to skip):
1: development
2: production
3: staging

Space> 1
Targeted space development

API endpoint: https://api.run.pivotal.io (API version: 2.0.0)
User:         user@example.com
Org:          my-org
Space:        development
</pre>

## <a id='prepare-app'></a>Prepare Your Application ##

The [Prepare to Deploy an Application]
(http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/prepare-to-deploy.html) topic
explains how to get your app ready for Cloud Foundry.

## <a id='push-app'></a>Push Your Application to the Cloud ##

To push an application to the cloud, use `cf push APPNAME`.

By default, `cf push APPNAME` creates a URL to your application in the form
HOST.DOMAIN, where:

* **HOST** is the APPNAME used with `cf push`
* **DOMAIN** is the default shared domain of your Cloud Foundry instance.

Example: `cf push my-app` creates the URL my-app.<%=vars.app_domain%>.

The URL to your application must be unique.

If you want to create a URL different from an existing URL, you can use the `-n`
flag to specify a different HOST when pushing your application.

Example: `cf push my-app -n something-else` creates the URL something-else.<%=vars.app_domain%>.

`cf` deploys your application using default values for the number of instances,
amount of memory each instance can use, and other deployment attributes.
You can override these defaults using command-line options.
See the
[push](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/installcf/whats-new-v6.html#push)
section of [Getting Started with cf v6](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/installcf/whats-new-v6.html) for
more information.

You can also specify deployment options in a manifest.
See [Deploying with Application Manifests](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html) for more information.



## <a id='troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting ##

If your application does not start on Cloud Foundry, first check that your
application can run locally.

You can also use `cf` to troubleshoot your application in the cloud.

### <a id='health'></a>Checking Health and Status ###

To check the health and status of your application, use `cf app APPNAME`.

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app my-app
Showing health and status for app my-app in org my-org / space development as user@example.com...
OK

requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 1G x 1 instances
urls: my-app.cfapps.io

     state     since                    cpu    memory        disk
#0   running   2014-01-24 05:07:18 PM   0.0%   18.5M of 1G   52.5M of 1G
</pre>
