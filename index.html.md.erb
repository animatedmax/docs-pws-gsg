title: Getting Started with Pivotal Web Services
---

You can deploy, update, and scale your applications on Pivotal Web Services (PWS), which is powered by the Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service (PaaS).

## <a id='signup'></a>Step 1: Set Up Your PWS Account ##

This step establishes your PWS account and access to the PWS Developer Console for your account.

Sign up for a Pivotal Web Services account: https://console.run.pivotal.io

The Developer Console displays after you create an [organization](../concepts/roles.html#organizations) (org). By default, PWS configures each new org with a [space](../concepts/roles.html#spaces) named `development`.

## <a id='install-login'></a>Step 2: Install the cf CLI ##

The `cf` CLI is your primary tool for deploying and managing your applications.

1. Click [Tools](https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools) on the left navigation menu of the Developer Console to access the Tools page.

1. Install the appropriate `cf` CLI version for your OS.
1. Run `cf help` to confirm that the tool is installed correctly.
The example shows the beginning lines of output for this command.

    <pre class=”terminal”>
    $ cf help
    NAME:
       cf - A command line tool to interact with Cloud Foundry

    USAGE:
       [environment variables] cf [global options] command [arguments...] [command options]
    ...
    </pre>

## <a id='connect-api'></a>Step 3: Point Your CLI to PWS##

This step targets the Cloud Foundry public API endpoint `api.run.pivotal.io` and establishes your connection to PWS.

1. Run `cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io`

1. Enter the email and password that you established in Step 1.

The example shows the output of this command. When your account contains only a single org and space, PWS automatically targets them. Otherwise, PWS prompts you to select an org and space.

<pre class=”terminal”>
$ cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io

API endpoint: https://api.run.pivotal.io

Email> clouduser@example.com

Password>
Authenticating...
OK

Targeted org Cloud-Apps

Targeted space development



API endpoint:   https://api.run.pivotal.io (API version: 2.8.0)
User:           clouduser@example.com
Org:            Cloud-Apps
Space:          development
</pre>

You are now ready to deploy applications.

## <a id='deploy-app'></a>Step 4: Deploy an Application to PWS ##

You can now deploy your app or a sample app to PWS.
