title: Getting Started with Pivotal Web Services
---

_This page assumes that you are using cf v6._

You can easily deploy, update, and scale your applications using the Cloud
Foundry Platform as a Service (PaaS) that powers Pivotal Web Services,
located at `run.pivotal.io`.

Complete the following steps to get started:

1. [Sign up for Pivotal Web Services and log in](#signup)
1. [Install the `cf` Command Line Interface and log in](#install-cf)
1. [Prepare an application on your local machine](#prepare-app)
1. [Push your application to the cloud](#push-app)

## <a id='signup'></a>Sign Up for Pivotal Web Services and Log In ##

[Sign up](https://console.run.pivotal.io) for a Pivotal Web Services account.

[Log in](https://login.run.pivotal.io/login).

**Note**: If you had an account on `cloudfoundry.com`, you can just log into
Pivotal Web Services using your `cloudfoundry.com` account credentials.

## <a id='install-login'></a>Install the cf Command Line Interface and Log In ##

`cf` is your primary tool for deploying, starting, stopping, configuring, and
checking the health of your applications.

### <a id='install-cf'></a>Download and Install cf ###

Download `cf` from the [tools page](https://console.run.pivotal.io/tools).

Complete the [installation instructions](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/installcf/index.html).

### <a id='target'></a>Target the API endpoint and log in ###

Run `cf api api.run.pivotal.io` to target the `run.pivotal.io` API endpoint.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf api api.run.pivotal.io
Setting api endpoint to api.run.pivotal.io...
OK

API endpoint: https://api.run.pivotal.io (API version: 2.0.0)
Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
</pre>

Run `cf login` to log in.
`cf` prompts you for your username, password, organization, and space.

Spaces are containers for applications and all their associated processes.
You can deploy your application to any of the three default spaces:
development, production, and staging.

## <a id='prepare-app'></a>Prepare Your Application ##

To get your app ready for Cloud Foundry, follow the instructions in the
[Prepare to Deploy an Application]
(http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/prepare-to-deploy.html) topic.

## <a id='push-app'></a>Push Your Application to the Cloud ##

Run `cf push APPNAME` to push your application to the cloud.

By default, `cf push APPNAME` creates a URL to your application in the form
HOST.DOMAIN, where:

* **HOST** is the APPNAME used with `cf push`
* **DOMAIN** is the default shared domain of your Cloud Foundry instance.

Example: `cf push my-app` creates the URL my-app.<%=vars.app_domain%>.

The URL to your application must be unique.

If you want to create a URL different from an existing URL, you can use the `-n`
flag to specify a different HOST when pushing your application.

Example: `cf push my-app -n something-else` creates the URL something-else.<%=vars.app_domain%>.

`cf` deploys your application using default values for the number of instances,
amount of memory each instance can use, and other deployment attributes.
You can override these defaults using command-line options.
See the
[push](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/installcf/whats-new-v6.html#push)
section of [Getting Started with cf v6](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/installcf/whats-new-v6.html) for
more information.

You can also specify deployment options in a manifest.
See [Deploying with Application Manifests](http://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html) for more information.


## <a id='troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting ##

If your application does not start on Cloud Foundry, first check that your
application can run locally.

You can also use `cf` to troubleshoot your application in the cloud.

### <a id='health'></a>Checking Health and Status ###

To check the health and status of your application, use `cf app APPNAME`.

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app my-app
Showing health and status for app my-app in org my-org / space development as user@example.com...
OK

requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 1G x 1 instances
urls: my-app.cfapps.io

     state     since                    cpu    memory        disk
#0   running   2014-01-24 05:07:18 PM   0.0%   18.5M of 1G   52.5M of 1G
</pre>
